The project uses Zephyr as the main OS (kernel, build system, device tree, Kconfig) and selectively integrates ESP-IDF drivers/libraries for camera, I2C (for camera sensor), and memory buffer allocation. ESP-IDF code is adapted as needed to work within Zephyr, replacing incompatible RTOS calls, memory allocation, and possibly hardware register access. Zephyr's configuration system (device tree, Kconfig) is used for all peripherals, even those using ESP-IDF drivers. The build system integrates ESP-IDF sources into Zephyr's CMake-based build. Testing is critical to avoid resource conflicts, and ongoing maintenance is required as Zephyr and ESP-IDF evolve. This hybrid approach is feasible and proven in practice for projects needing both reliability and flexibility.
